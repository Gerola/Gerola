### Hi there ğŸ‘‹
I'm Matthew Gerola currently pursuing a Computer Science degree at Washington State University and will graduate in the spring of 2024. When I graduate I have the goal of working in the cybersecurity industry. I want to pursue a job in this industry because I am fascinated by the field and all that encompasses it.
